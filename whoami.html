            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Matthew Lyons, and this is some information about me...</p>
            <p>I am passionate about A.I. developement and sustainability and enjoy my family.</p>
            <p>I have served in the United Stated Air Force for 12 years as a Biomedical Equipment Technician. Occupationally my
            responsibilities are maintaining, installing, and repairing medical devices to include, but not limited to, Thermometers,
            patient montitoring devices, X-Ray and MRI units, and dental equipment. I currently hold great stock in gold and crypto
            with more in value than i have been paid over my 12 years of service combined.</p>
            <p>One great fear that i have is that the future will hold little in the way for common people (99% of the population) as the powers
            and rights of those in positions to make the most impact expand while restricting the chance for others to have the most basic powers
            over themselves.</p>
            <p>I believe the cure for this should be distributed much like a vaccination that requires boosters:</p>
            <div>
            <li>Step 1: The Sovernty of Self</li>
            <p>Much like the teachings of Johannes Voat summarised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-ownership">here</a> without ownership of ones self and all rights
            exclusively reserved; slavery, in one form or another, will always resurface. Looking at the average American debt for example one can see this problem take life as
            the right to property becomes an ever fleeting ideal.</p>
            <li>Step 2: The Abolishment of Representation</li>
            <p>The Constitution of the United States was written at a time in which the fastest possible way to transfer informaiton was by carrier pigeon (to some extent that
            is still true). It would take a Representative from New York several days to ride to the capital to represent their constituents. The founding father would have never
            thought, unless great fantasy or fiction absorbed them, that someone from D.C. could communicate with someone from China within seconds. As firearm abolitionists proclaim
            that the purpose of the Second Amendment is out dated I proclaim that the entire constinution is outdated. With that i say let no man, woman, or child (save for their guardians
            that rightfully guide them to be citizens of sound mind and body) let anyone represent their thoughts, feelings, opinions, or any other application of the mind. <br>
            I wish to ask you: Is it easier to corrupt 100 people with 1 dollar each to change their vote or 1 person with 100 dollars? <br>
            This would solve the fallacy of voting under a two partied system.
            </p>
            <li>Step 3: Nationalized Land and Resources</li>
            <p>I will never forget the day that i watch President Trump (please keep reading), standing at the GOP candidate debate, and address all of his opponents saying "I Paid for Your campaign
            and your campaign". Also I recall President Biden pleading with oil corporations to "bring the price of fuel down." I will admit before a continute that the following is a grand topic and
            much research must be done to fully understand it but from my perspective: Money should have no place in politics (in terms of backing candidates) and America should own its own resources.
            It also is baffling how foreign countries can purchase land in America while Americans struggle due to the massive expanse from companies Like BlackRock that owns US$9.42 trillion Assets
            Under Management.</p>
